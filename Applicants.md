# Jordan Kupfer

- Interested in practical rocketry, done a lot of programming and data analysis
- President of the men's lacrosse club, organizational and time management
- More interested in the theoretical / computer side of things than the hands-on mechanical side of things, possibly not the best fit for a structures team but definitely a good fit for software / ground structures.
- Likes planes, likes rockets, will have a steep learning curve for Structures
