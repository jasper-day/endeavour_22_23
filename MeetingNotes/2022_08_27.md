Notes for meeting Aug 27 2022
=============


# Plan for Next Year

Go to Mach 2023, no return to Euroc (focus on developing knowledge base for the team wrt launching rockets & designing holistically)

Mach 2023 is still in flux, plans change quickly so nothing certain yet.

- Combined entry (rocket and payload) 
- Working on a rocket (2-stage :) )

- Get [L1 rocketry certification](https://www.nar.org/high-power-rocketry-info/level-1-hpr-certification-procedures/) for licensing for motors

[UK Team Project Support](http://ukra.org.uk/tps)

---

## Structures:

Team lead meetings

Documentation / **knowledge bases**

- wiki software
- documentation for every part
- integrated documentation procedure for design from the ground up

Return to basics:

- Smaller and more rocket launches
- Different design challenges

Not mentioned:

- Improve prototyping process, prototype early and often to sanity check / have tangible products / run lots of tests

## Recovery

Split the goal into two different areas:

1. R & D focus: Everything short of building
	a. Three-ring systems
	b. Exotic recovery systems (rotor recovery / autorotation)
		i. Gives more space for deployable payload, experiments on the effect of rotation (have set rotation rate when falling)
2. Create flight-ready systems in time for Mach 23
	a. Look into starting the (in-house?) manufacture of drogue chute 
	b. Reduce dependence on COTS equipment
3. Knowledge bank

## Software

- Switch to monolithic flight computer system with more advanced (rpi)
- Live video streaming
- Knowledge base for software components

> Note for Jasper:

> Airbrake project with Pablo, further development.

> Find better VCS software

## Avionics

- Developing a database for what building a flight computer entails, get people skilled in Altium and PCB design software, potentially changing geometry from horizontal to vertical stack

## Payload

- Keep up quality design
- One payload (no Euroc) -- but we could have 2 cansats with a 2 stage :)
- Minimize knowledge gap between mechanical and software
- Experiment with PCB layout, live camera systems, automatic data uploading (fun with low-altitude rocketry)

## Local Launches

- Expand our footing in Scotland
	- Launch D2 / D1
	- Model rocket outreach
	- Water rocket outreach / socials / team-building

## Recruitment

- Get an idea of the team structure: 
	- *How many people do you need to recruit?*
	- Current member numbers
	- Team strengths
	- Places you want to recruit from: informatics, physics, engineering, etc
	- If you think you need 4 people, recruit 5; better to have too many than too few people
		- Attrition rates are considerable.
- Next week is Welcome Week!
	- Engineering fair Tues Sep 13

## Other notes

- Merch is on the way - 5 week lead time
- Switching away from solidworks? ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶

# Main Takeaways:

- Big goal: 2-stage rocket for Mach 23
- Knowledge base using cross-referenced wiki software
