# Darwin Structures 2022: First Assignment

Hello to everyone from sunny Portugal! I hope you've enjoyed your weekends, it was great seeing you at our first Structures meeting.

As I mentioned in the meeting, the next two weeks are going to be asynchronous, since most of the team leads (myself included) are at the European Rocketry Competition getting ready to fly our 9 km sounding rocket. However, I imagine that you all are itching to get started with your first design challenge, so here it is! 

The Student Experience Fund is giving us a grant to get high-powered licenses for members of the team who want to be able to launch rockets on their own. (Hopefully this means you!) To make the best use of this money, we're going to make a lot of rockets, which means that we need a solid launch vehicle design that can fly with common H- and I-class motors. Over the next two weeks, I want everyone to come up with their own conceptual design for this vehicle, and play around in OpenRocket to max out its apogee. Here are some tips for making your designs:

- As always, start with the nosecone and body tubes. You won't be able to select a motor until you have at least one body tube to select as a motor mount.
- The different motors have percentages after their names: 100% would be the maximum impulse for that class (e.g. H), 0% would be the minimum impulse necessary to be an H motor.
- Hit "show details" in the motor choosing tab to see the burn time, thrust curve, and mass statistics.
- (important) You can see the effects of every design choice on the expected apogee in the lower left hand corner of the screen. Please keep in mind that these estimates will not be accurate if something is messing up your rocket's flight! Blockers include:
    - Rocket not stable. If the red dot (center of pressure) is in front of the blue dot (center of gravity), your rocket will tumble before apogeeing. Add fins (or make them larger) and add weight to the front of the rocket.
    - Parachutes releasing too soon. If this keeps happening, set the ejection charge of your motor (drop down menu at the top of motor selection screen) to "None".
- The rockets will be made out of fiberglass. If you want, check out UK suppliers and see what tube sizes are readily available off-the-shelf, and use those sizes.
    - Speaking of tube sizes: H motors generally come in 29mm and 38mm ODs. A "minimum diameter" rocket uses body tubes whose IDs match the ODs of the motor. Minimum diameter rockets are great for maxing out apogees, but they're less flexible as a platform for various flight hardware. The choice is yours.
- Ways to make your design more realistic:
    - Add coupling tubes wherever the rocket will separate to release parachutes. Place bulkheads around this (your choice of material) to create a pressure chamber and mount your flight hardware.
    - Think about your materials: we have easy access to 3D printed plastic, laser cut plywood/acrylic/polycarb, fiberglass, and aluminum. We can also use steel, carbon fiber, etc, but those materials are the most accessible.

As always, any questions, please ask. We'll go over the designs at our first meeting after the team leads return; I'll make another poll as that date approaches to determine when exactly that will be. I'll ask everyone to go over the apogee they reached and what they considered to get there. 

Until then, good luck and happy rocketeering!
